# LLM Comparison App

## Overview

The **LLM Comparison App** is a web application built with **React** that allows users to compare the outputs of three different Large Language Models (LLMs) for two specific use cases:

1. **Code Generation**: Compare how various LLM models generate code based on user prompts.
2. **Image Generation**: Compare how different LLM models generate images from text descriptions.

This project is intended to help developers and users evaluate and compare the performance of different models for tasks like code generation and image creation. 

---

## Features

- **Model Comparison**: Compare outputs from three different LLM models for either code or image generation.
- **Dynamic Use Case Switching**: Easily switch between code generation and image generation use cases.
- **Evaluation & Scoring**: Rate the results based on various evaluation criteria (e.g., correctness, creativity, relevance, etc.).
- **Prompt Input**: Users can enter their own prompts to generate code or images.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: After comparing model outputs, users can submit scores and additional feedback.

---

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface and handling state.
- **JavaScript**: The main programming language for front-end functionality.
- **CSS**: For styling the app (customized for the comparison and model output display).
- **API Integration**: The app fetches results from the backend API for code and image generation.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llm-comparison-app.git
cd llm-comparison-app
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Start the development server:**

```bash
npm start
```

This will open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## How to Use

1. **Choose a Use Case**: 
   - Click on the "Code Generation" or "Image Generation" button to switch between use cases.

2. **Select Models**:
   - Choose three different models (A, B, C) to compare for the selected use case.

3. **Enter a Prompt**:
   - Type a prompt related to code or image generation (e.g., write a function or describe an image).

4. **Generate Outputs**:
   - Click the "Generate and Compare" button to get the outputs from the selected models.

5. **Rate the Models**:
   - After reviewing the results, rate each model's output on various evaluation criteria (e.g., correctness, creativity, relevance, etc.).

6. **Submit Evaluation**:
   - Once you’ve rated all models, submit your evaluation to provide feedback.

## Evaluation Criteria

### Code Generation:

- **Correctness**: Does the code solve the problem correctly?
- **Efficiency**: Is the algorithm optimal in terms of time/space complexity?
- **Readability**: Is the code easy to understand and well-structured?
- **Robustness**: Does the code handle edge cases appropriately?
- **Documentation**: Are there helpful comments explaining the logic?

### Image Generation:

- **Relevance**: How well does the image match the prompt?
- **Quality**: Is the image clear, detailed, and visually appealing?
- **Creativity**: Does the image show originality and imagination?
- **Consistency**: Are the elements in the image coherent and properly integrated?
- **Composition**: Is the layout and framing of the image well-balanced?

## Future Improvements

- **Backend Integration**: Add functionality for model integration with APIs like OpenAI, Stability AI, etc., for real-time generation.
- **Multi-Use Case Support**: Expand the app to support additional use cases such as text summarization or translation.
- **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication for saving past evaluations and feedback.
